############# Rmusicmetric: some functions for the musicmetric.com beta api ##################################

Notes:

Provided are two very simple R helper functions that allow an R session to call out to  
musicmetric.com to access thier beta API and return the json data as native R objects.

You'll need to use an API token to access thier site which you can apply for here:
http://developer.musicmetric.com/index.html

The main purpose of the functions are to demonstrate that the artist "plays" timeseries data provided over the 
api can be charted and studied in R using the terrific quantmod charting library. This is made possible through
reshaping the raw timeseries vector data into a proper XTS formatted object.

The hope is that once the data is formatted as XTS, interesting statistical analysis can be conducted on this data.

When I get a moment I'd like to extend the library to all of their supported API calls.
If you get there ahead of me, do get in touch and I'll build out a library of the helper functions here.

These functions are released on a flexible MIT license, and further details are available here:

If you do use this code in your projects attribution would be appreciated.
